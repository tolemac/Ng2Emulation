This is a personal note from the lead project, Javier Ros (tolemaC)

## Why I chose not to use ng-forward?

At the beginning of this project I were searching info about the project and demand feedback to other users and communities.
someone tells me about [ng-forward](https://github.com/ngUpgraders/ng-forward), I didn't know `ng-forward` project.

First of all, I have nothing against "ng-forward" I think it is a good project, led by people who know what it does. But ...

I confess, I'm not a pure javascript developer, I don't not use node.js for my projects, I didn't know NPM until recently.
When I found `ng-forward` I started to learn npm, nodejs, gulp, ... using brackets, sublime, VSCode, ... 
After a few days I got it to work, then I wanted to use it in my main project. My main project is a ASP.NET project wrote using Visual Studio.

I did not get `ng-forward` to work using Visual Studio. I lack knowledge about systemjs, transpiler, traceur, babel, npm dependencies, ...

In the end I decided to continue my own project.

My respects to `ng-forward` project.
